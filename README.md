# How to run and control the turtlebot2?
Step1: type 'roscore' in a terminal.  
Step2: open a new terminal and type 'roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch'.  
Step3: enter the directory where the file 'interface.py' is, and run it. (You can change the variable 'speed' and 'steer' in the python file, otherwise the turtlebot won't move.)
  
# What we need to do?
Write some codes between 'input' and 'output', to realize some function.
